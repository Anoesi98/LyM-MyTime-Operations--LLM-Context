Operations Manager Portal - Simple Breakdown
Overview
The Operations Manager portal is essentially a restricted version of the Admin portal. It has the same layout, navigation structure, and UI components, but with specific features and data access removed to maintain proper separation of duties and security.

Core Philosophy
Admin Portal: "You can do EVERYTHING"
Operations Manager Portal: "You can MANAGE day-to-day operations, but cannot modify financial/system settings"

What's THE SAME
1. Layout & Navigation Structure
✅ Same sidebar layout
✅ Same collapsible navigation
✅ Same dark/light mode
✅ Same language toggle (English/Spanish)
✅ Same company filter/toggle
✅ Same responsive design
✅ Same page templates (DataTable, Forms, Charts)
2. Shared Pages (with restrictions)
Both portals have pages for:

Dashboard
Analytics
Clients
Departments
Stores
Staff
Users (view only for OM)
Companies (view only for OM)
Orders
Inventory
Products
Vendors
Routes
Disputes
Invoices
Recurring Billing
Chat
Settings (limited for OM)
User Logs (view only for OM)

Key Invoice Edit Request Workflow
This is the main workaround for Operations Managers who can't edit financial data:

How It Works:
Operations Manager finds an invoice that needs correction
Clicks "Request Edit" button
Fills out form:
Reason for edit
Proposed changes (new customer, new amount, etc.)
Urgency level
Request is saved to InvoiceEditRequest entity
Admin sees notification on Admin Dashboard
Admin reviews request via AdminInvoiceRequests page
Admin can:
Approve → Makes the changes automatically
Reject → With reason
Request more info
Operations Manager gets notified of decision
If approved, invoice is updated automatically
This workflow maintains:

Financial controls (admin approval required)
Audit trail (every change logged)
Operations efficiency (OM can initiate needed changes)
Accountability (both parties' actions tracked)
Permission Enforcement
How Restrictions Are Enforced:
1. Navigation Level:

// navigationConfig.js
export const navigationConfig = {
  admin: [...full menu...],
  operations_manager: [...restricted menu...]
};

// Layout.js
const navRole = user.app_role || user.role;
const navigation = navigationConfig[navRole] || [];
2. Page Level:

// OperationsBookkeeping.jsx (doesn't exist)
// If OM tries to access /OperationsBookkeeping, they hit:
<PermissionGuard requiredRole="admin">
  <BookkeepingContent />
</PermissionGuard>
// Shows "Permission Denied" page
3. Component Level:

// In DataTable
{user.app_role === 'admin' && (
  <Button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</Button>
)}

{user.app_role === 'operations_manager' && (
  <Button onClick={handleRequestEdit}>Request Edit</Button>
)}
4. Entity Level (RLS):

// Some entities have Row-Level Security
{
  "rls": {
    "read": {
      "user_condition": { "app_role": "admin" }
    },
    "write": {
      "user_condition": { "app_role": "admin" }
    }
  }
}

In Simple Terms:
Think of it this way:

Admin = Company Owner

Can hire/fire
Can see all money
Can change prices
Can delete anything
Has all the keys
Operations Manager = Store Manager

Can run daily operations
Can see sales numbers
Can suggest price changes
Can request deletions
Has most keys, but not the safe
The Operations Manager portal gives enough power to run the business day-to-day without giving access to financial controls, system configuration, or permanent data deletion that should be reserved for administrators.
